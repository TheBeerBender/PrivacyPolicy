  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: <strong>May&nbsp;25, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <em>SoundScape</em> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use the SoundScape iOS application (the "App").</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> With your permission, the App accesses your precise location in the background. Location is used <em>only</em> to detect when you enter or exit the zones you create. Location data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Music Library Data.</strong> When you link Apple Music, the App uses MusicKit to browse your library and play songs. We do not copy, upload, or share your music data.</li>
    <li><strong>User Files.</strong> The zones and soundscapes you create are saved on-device. They leave the device only when you explicitly export them via the share menu.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display your current position on the map.</li>
    <li>To trigger music playback when you enter or exit a zone.</li>
    <li>To let you browse and assign tracks from your Apple Music library.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share your personal information with third parties. Location and zone data never leave your device. Music playback is handled by Apple Music under Apple’s privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>All personal data stays on your device until you delete the App. You can erase zones at any time from within the App or delete the App to remove all data.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may revoke location permission at any time in iOS Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Location Services.</li>
    <li>You may disconnect Apple Music access in iOS Settings ▸ Music ▸ Apps with Access.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in-app and the "Effective date" above will be updated.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@SoundScape.app">support@SoundScape.app</a>.</p>
